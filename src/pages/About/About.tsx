      My name is Ben, and I've been in software engineering for over 12 years, predominantly in ad tech. My passion is
      to build products, whether it's for customers engaging in our business or building an internal tool to make our
      lives easier.

      Some of my favorite achievements:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Led a team in the complete rewrite of legacy product, bringing in modern technologies and architecture, and
          seeing it succeed in the market
        </li>
        <li>
          Have seen multiple of my hackathon projects clear the boundary of fun to functional, and become critical
          pieces in production
        </li>
        <li>Leveled up the culture of multiple teams towards engineering excellence</li>
      </ul>

      I've developed this blog to offer solutions to interesting problems I've come across, ranging from Java to
      JavaScript, Devops (Kubernetes, tracing, monitoring) to random hacks. And of course there could be a decent bit of
      random other interests.
